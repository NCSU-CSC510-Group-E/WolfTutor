\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, Group-P presents an improvement on WolfTutor, a Slack-based
  platform for connecting students and facilitating peer tutoring.  Group-P's
  work adds a recommendation module on top of WolfTutor's student-tutor matching
  system that attempts to find a tutor that fits into the using student's
  desires.  A two-pronged approach to validation is also enacted where the
  system's algorithm is put through basic validation and the ease-of-use of the
  system is evaluated using in-person time trials with specific goals in mind.
  Finally, the group discusses the results of the evaluation and discusses
  future validation and improvements that will need to be done to make the
  application robust enough to use in a live educational environment.
