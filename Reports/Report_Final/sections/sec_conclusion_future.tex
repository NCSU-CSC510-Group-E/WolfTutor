\subsubsection{Further Evaluation}
\label{sec:further-evaluation}
The team has made a best effort to evaluate the algorithm presented in this
paper both using a manually-labeled data set and using in-person interviews with
potential users. That said, true evaluation of educational software must be done
in a classroom setting.
