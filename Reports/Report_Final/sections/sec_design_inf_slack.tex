\paragraph{Slack}
As mentioned previously, the target for this chat bot is to run in the Slack
platform.  Slack is primarily a business tool intended to help facilitate
communication and coordination between individuals and groups at organizations.
In practice, however, Slack has found a home in many unintended audiences such
as online communities and even university courses such as this one.  

While it is true that this bot has been deployed to Slack specifically, it was
developed using a popular API called Botkit, which actually has APIs for
multiple chat services such as Facebook Messenger or Discord as well as Slack.
Because of this, it is possible to port WolfTutor to these other platforms
without needing to entirely start over.

\paragraph{Slack Bot}
The Slack bot handles the interactions between the user and the NodeJS applications. 
All responses given by the user would be posted to the application by the bot. 
Similarily, all prompts sent to the user from application would be posted to Slack by the bot.
