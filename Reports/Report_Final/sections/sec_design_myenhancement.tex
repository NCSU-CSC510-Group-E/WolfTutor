As mentioned in section \ref{sec:tutor-matching} the goal of this project is to
improve the matching done by WolfTutor.  In its original form, students input
only what subject they were interested in a tutor for and the system returned
back all students in that given subject.  While effective, this brute-force
strategy can wind up showing students an extremely large number of potential
tutors in their chat app, which can be somewhat challenging to navigate.

The original system also displayed fairly little information about the tutor
when searching.  The list of tutors returned by the ``find a tutor''
functionality contained basic information such as name and major, but did not
include information about the performance of the tutor academically or their
reviews.  To see reviews, the searching student would have to hit a ``review''
button which would then display all the reviews that tutor had at the bottom of
the screen. While this technically made the necessary information available,
this UI was challenging to use, and after getting feedback from the first round
of reviews, the team decided to make some changes to this process.  

First and foremost, however, the goal of this project is to improve the process
of chosing a tutor in WolfTutor by providing a filtered list of tutors to
students when they search for tutors in the system.
