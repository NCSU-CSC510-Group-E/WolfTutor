What should an intro do?

\subsection{WolfTutor}
\label{sec:wolftutor}

In this section, we need to briefly explain what Wolftutor is

\subsection{Tutor Matching}
\label{sec:tutor-matching}

In this section, we should make the case that Wolftutor's matching needs
improvement and point out who would benefit from better matching/why.

This section should also introduce our system and explain why what we're doing
is appropriate.
