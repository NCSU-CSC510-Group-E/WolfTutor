WolfTutor's existing mechanisms for matching students to tutors are fairly
rudimentary.  When tutors register for the application, they are asked to give a
set of subjects they are comfortable helping on (the list of which is determined
and maintained by system administrators) and a list of days and times they are
available to instruct.  % TODO: what the fuck is "to instruct", zach?

% TODO: we could make a better case for why this was the original featureset.
While immediately useful, this is not nearly as far as the system could go in
terms of matching students with tutors. 

This section should also introduce our system and explain why what we're doing
is appropriate.
