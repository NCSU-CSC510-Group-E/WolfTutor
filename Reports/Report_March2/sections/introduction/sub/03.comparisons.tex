The application of WolfTutor is not actually specific to tutoring entirely.
It can reasonably be compared to any scheduling system.
For example, the appointment scheduling tool within NC State University's epack system functions similarily.
First you pick from an available list of appointment types. Then, you can opt to filter your search further by location, names of possible appointees, time of day, etc.
The tool will show available appointment time slots a user can book.
This type of scheduling mechanism is commonly used by other services as well e.g. medical facilities with multiple practitioners, personal trainers, etc.

There are no similar applications relevant to automative tutoring matching. Most services only offer a place to find tutors manually, such as Craiglist. Some services take other approaches. The popular tutoring service, Chegg, does not facilitate scheduling or tutoring sessions, but instead lets multiple tutors cater to a student's question.
